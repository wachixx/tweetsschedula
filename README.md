# Getting Started with Create React App
# Simple react js app to schedule tweets.

## How to run
1. checkout this repo
2. Run ```npm install``` in the project repo
3. Run ```npm start```

## Assumptions during the project
1. There are no logins
2. The twitter account is hard coded
3.  No media upload during this phase

## Implementation
1. Broke the app into 3 components (Tweet, modal, and the form)
2. The app uses Context API to manage state
3. Used a custom hook to implement form processing and validations

## Time taken
Took 3 days working on this. I spend about 3 hours each day it.
